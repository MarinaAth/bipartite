# Bipartite network connecting gene co-expression modules and the metabolic potential of the dietary source
Interactions between differentially co-expressed modules in a eukaryote and bacterial metabolic pathways 

The bipartite network is constructed based on the differential expression of a gene co-expression module on the metabolic potential of the bacterial diet and the nematode's transcriptomic profile.
